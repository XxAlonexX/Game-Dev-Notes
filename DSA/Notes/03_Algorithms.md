>Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or sets of rules for solving specific problems or performing tasks in a computer program. They are fundamental in computer science and are used extensively in various fields, including software development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Here are examples of common algorithms.

# Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that partitions the list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and combines them.
- **Merge Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the list into smaller lists, sorts them, and merges them together.
# Searching Algorithms
- **Linear Search**: A basic searching algorithm that checks each element in a list one by one until a match is found.
- **Binary Search**: A more efficient searching algorithm that works on sorted lists by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
# Pathfinding Algorithms
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.
- A Algorithm* : A popular pathfinding algorithm that combines Dijkstra's algorithm with heuristics to find the shortest path efficiently.
# Graph Algorithms
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Used for traversing or searching in graphs, often used in shortest path algorithms.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Another graph traversal algorithm used for various graph-related tasks.
# Dynamic Programming Algorithms
- **Fibonacci Sequence using Memoization**: A dynamic programming approach to efficiently calculate Fibonacci numbers.
- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: Used for finding the longest subsequence common to two sequences, often used in text comparison.
# Tree Algorithms
- **Binary Tree Traversal** (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder): Used to visit nodes in binary trees in different orders.
- **Balanced Binary Search Tree (e.g., AVL Tree)**: A self-balancing binary search tree used for efficient searching and insertion.
# String Matching Algorithms
- **Brute Force String Matching**: A basic algorithm to find occurrences of a substring in a text.
- **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm**: A more efficient algorithm for substring searching.
# Machine Learning Algorithms
- **Linear Regression**: Used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised learning algorithm used for data clustering.
# Compression Algorithms
**Huffman Coding**: Used for data compression by encoding characters with variable-length codes.
# Hashing Algorithms
**SHA-256**: A cryptographic hash function used for data security and integrity checks.
# Backtracking Algorithms
**N-Queens Problem**: An example of a backtracking algorithm used to find all solutions to the N-Queens puzzle.
# Greedy Algorithms
**Dijkstra's Algorithm**: It can also be categorized as a greedy algorithm for finding the shortest path.
# Genetic Algorithms
Used in optimization and search problems, inspired by the process of natural selection.
