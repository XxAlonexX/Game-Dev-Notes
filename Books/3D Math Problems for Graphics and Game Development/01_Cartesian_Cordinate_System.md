- 3D math involves precise measurements in 3D space using the Cartesian coordinate system.
- René Descartes, a renowned philosopher, invented Cartesian mathematics.
- Descartes also explored the question of determining the truth.
#### **Discrete vs. Continuous Mathematics**
Discrete mathematics (dealing with natural numbers and integers) and continuous mathematics (dealing with real numbers). Discrete mathematics involves countable elements, while continuous mathematics deals with uncountable, continuous elements.
## 2D Cartesian
You probably have used 2D Cartesian coordinate systems even if you have
never heard the term “Cartesian” before. “Cartesian” is mostly just a fancy
word for “rectangular.” If you have ever looked at the floor plans of a house,
used a street map, seen a football1 game, or played chess, you have some
exposure to 2D Cartesian coordinate spaces.
